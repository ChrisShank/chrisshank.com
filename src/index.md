Welcome to my little part of the internet! I'm Chris Shank and this website is a collection of ideas, notes, and writings that I have been thinking through. Think of it like walking through a small garden that I'm cultivating. Some of the thoughts might be incomplete (and possibly incoherent) while others may have blossomed 🌺.

Currently I am exploring the intersection between learning an technology, trying to _push_ how far technology can augment the learning process. The goal is find ways for us to learn more effectively and more accessible. 📚 This project is called the [The Learning Toolbox](https://learningtoolbox.io).

If you want to learn more about me continue reading about me [here](/about)!
